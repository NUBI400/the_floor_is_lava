This project was a test of many things that I found interesting, I thought it would be cool to put them together and turn them into a silly game.

"the flower is lava" is literally a floor and lava in a giant house xd.

When you enter the game, click on the HOST option, it has this because I tried to make a LAN multiplayer system that works, but the guest player is not able to interact correctly with the objects, which makes it unplayable.


Controls: 
W A S D = walk 
shift = run 
ctrl = crouch 
space = jump 

left mouse = grab object
right mouse = throw
F = leave object static
R = rotate object


Made in Godot in 2024.
