This is a test project where I learned how to make and use a relatively complex weapons system. I was inspired by COD zombies when I came up with the idea of ​​making this project.  
It is a wave game with zombies on a CS1.6 map.  
It contains 3 purchasable weapons near the spawn, one of which is the starting pistol and a purchasable medkit.  

Controls: 
W A S D = walk 
left mouse = shoot 
right mouse = aim 
shift = run 
ctrl = crouch 
space = jump 
E = interact  

Made in Godot in 2024.
